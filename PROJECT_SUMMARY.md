# AI Tutor Chat System - Project Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Project Setup**
   - Set up project structure following FastAPI conventions
   - Configured dependencies with uv package manager
   - Added development tools (pytest, black, isort, mypy, ruff)
   - Created repository guidelines in `.openhands/repo.md`

2. **Core Models**
   - Implemented Pydantic models for chat conversations
   - Created StudentMessage and TutorMessage models
   - Implemented ConversationThread model

3. **Services**
   - Implemented C3Service for retrieving content based on USMOS
   - Created ConversationService for managing conversation threads
   - Implemented TutorService for AI response generation
   - Fixed datetime serialization in ConversationService

4. **API Endpoints**
   - Created endpoints for starting conversations
   - Added endpoints for sending messages
   - Implemented regeneration of tutor responses
   - Added endpoint for retrieving conversation history

5. **Testing**
   - Implemented tests for models, services, and API endpoints
   - Fixed async/await syntax in test files
   - Added proper mocking for Redis in tests
   - Created comprehensive TDD test suite in test_tdd_chat.py
   - Fixed pytest-asyncio configuration in pyproject.toml

## Pending Tasks

1. **Redis Integration**
   - Set up Redis for production use
   - Configure connection pooling
   - Implement proper error handling for Redis operations

2. **AI Service Integration**
   - Configure AI service with actual LLM credentials
   - Implement proper error handling for AI service
   - Add fallback mechanisms for AI service failures

3. **C3 Service Integration**
   - Implement actual C3 service integration
   - Add caching for C3 service responses
   - Implement error handling for C3 service

4. **API Improvements**
   - Fix failing API tests
   - Add proper error handling and logging
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add authentication and authorization

5. **Frontend Development**
   - Create frontend UI for the chat interface
   - Implement real-time updates using WebSockets
   - Add user authentication UI

## Technical Decisions

1. **Redis for Conversation Storage**
   - Using redis-om for object mapping
   - Conversations are stored as JSON documents
   - Using Redis for its speed and simplicity

2. **FastAPI for API Development**
   - Using FastAPI for its performance and ease of use
   - Leveraging Pydantic for data validation
   - Using dependency injection for services

3. **DSPy for AI Response Generation**
   - Using DSPy for structured AI response generation
   - Simplified implementation to avoid dependency issues
   - Easy to extend with more complex AI models

4. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Comprehensive test coverage for models, services, and API
   - Using pytest-asyncio for testing async functions
   - Proper mocking for external dependencies
   - Implemented TDD approach with tests for each component
   - Created isolated tests with proper dependency mocking
   - Fixed DSPy integration issues with proper error handling

## Next Steps

1. Complete the pending tasks in order of priority
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
3. Create documentation for API endpoints
4. Implement monitoring and logging
5. Set up production environment
